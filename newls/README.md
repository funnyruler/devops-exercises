## Task
Implement a script `newls.sh` that can display the sizes of all the files and directories in a specified directory. The output format should be the same as the `ls -lh` command.

- Write the required sh script into the `newls.sh`.
- Ensure that the output format matches exactly with the `ls -lh` command.
- The `ls -lh` command displays the full year, not just the specific time, when the file was last modified more than six months ago.


## How to use

- Upload script on the server
- Give executable rights - `chmod +x newls.sh`
- Run the script by typing `./newls.sh`
